// How to create the delay

1. The TIMxCLK frequency is required -> we can check the clock configuration in STM32Cube MX and the required Timer clock
2. Decide the required pre-scalar. A pre-scalar is a factor that divides the Timer clock(basically slows it down)
    e.g. if TIMxCLK is 50 MHz, then a PSC value of 50k divides the clock frequency 50000 times and we get the CNT_CLK as 1KHz
3. Find the time period of the CNT_CLK i.e. 1/CNT_CLK
    for above that is 1ms since CNT_CLK was 1KHz
   This is the period that makes one increment in the Counter. A max of 65536 * 1ms is possible(using a 16 bit ARR)
 
 Note: Prescalar value : always insert one less than the pre-scalar in the STM32Cube MX
       

Checklist in creating a delay program:

1. msp.c
       a) Enable TIMx clock
       b) Enable the IRQ for the TIMx
       
 2. main.c
       a) Prototype for the callback (in case of interrupts) - check reason for callback and implement the correct one
       b) callback function definition
       c) HAL_TIM_BASE_START(&htimx)
